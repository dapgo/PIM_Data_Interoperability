SLicense
Introduction

The aim of this project is to research, document and develop solutions against the loss of access to information due the fact that there are many risks for our information. And information and data his too important to expose to loss.
Reasons, potential risks and current scenario

    Lack of standards on file format (sqlite, json,….)
    Lack of standards on data estructure (different fields, type, tables)
    Lack of Import/export functions (many apps cannot even export to CSV)
    Cycle life of Commercial apps/closed source (years after an app is abandoned, hardware can be incompatible with our old software)
    Change of Platform, software maybe is not available for our new platform (iOS, Android, Linux, Windows, MacOS, Blackberry, ….)
    Existance of non IT skilled users, probably they are not aware of these risks and will not decide a software thinking in interoperability
